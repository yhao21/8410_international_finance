\section{The seven ages}

\subsection{Seven of them}
The Paleolithic Age

The Neolithic Age

The Equestrian Age

The Classical Age

The Ocean Age

The Industrial Age

The Digital Age


\subsection{The Paleolithic Age 70,000 BCE -- 10,000 BCE}
Long-distance interactions were by migration.

\subsection{The Neolithic (new stone) Age 10,000 BCE -- 3000 BCE}
1. The fundamental breakthrough was agriculture, both crop cultivation
and animal husbandry.

2. From nomadism to sedentary life in villages.

3. Human interaction widened from the clan to the village and to
politics and {\underline {trade}} between villages. (gemstones, shells,
minerals, tools.)


\subsection{The Equestrian Age 3000 BCE -- 1000 BCE}
People label it as the Copper and Bronze age. But the author prefers
to emphasize the role of the horse over that of the minerals.

1. Domesticated horse make rapid, long-distance overland transport
and communication became possible.


\subsection{The Classical (imperial) Age 1000 BCE -- 1500 CE}
The rise and intense competition of large land-based empire.

The major empires were spurred by new religious and philosophical 
outlooks, e.g., Greco-Roman world.

The imperial age ushered in trans-Eurasian trade.


\subsection{The Ocean Age 1500 CE -- 1800 CE}
1. Imperial powers of Europe conquering and colonizing tropical regions
in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.

2. Revolutionary changes in global trade ensued, e.g., multinational
corporations, transoceanic trade, mass movement of people across the
oceans (enslavement of Africans).

3. Politics also became global in scale for the first time.


\subsection{The Industrial Age 1800 -- 2000}

Technology breakthrough, e.g., steam engine, internal combustion engine.

Global populations soared (increase rapidly) as a result of massive
increases in food production.

Global hegemon occur, Great Britain, and later, the United States.


\subsection{The Digital Age 2000 -- now}
Transfer from hegemonic power to a multipolar world.


\section{The acceleration of change}
Three dimensions of long-term change: total population, the rate of
urbanization, and the global output per person.


\section{Economic scale and the pace of change}

The most fundamental reason for the takeoff of economic growth around
1800 is therefore scale. With larger market, there can be more
specialization in job tasks.

In the Equestrian Age, for the first time, humanity was organized into
recognizable states, no longer merely interspersed villages.

With the voyages of Christopher Columbus, and Vasco da Gama, and the
transition to the {\underline {Ocean Age}}, scale increased yet again.
The world population soared again as food varieties were exchanged
across the oceans. Wheat from Old World to the Americas, and maize
from the Americas to the Old World.



\section{Malthusian Pessimism}
He argued that following any rise in productivity, the world would 
simply end up with more poor people, but with {\underline {no long-
term}} solution to poverty.


\section{Transformation to Urban Life}
Economic activities are usefully categorized into {\underline {three}}
productive sectors, called the {\underline {primary}},
{\underline {secondary, and tertiary sectors.}}

{\textbf {The primary sector}} includes the production of food and
feed crops, animal products, other agriculture, and mining products.

{\textbf {The secondary sector}}, or industrial sector, involves 
the transformation of primary commodities to final products, e.g., 
building, machinery, processed foods, and electric power.

{\textbf {The tertiary sector}} involves services that support 
productive activities, individual wellbeing, and governance.



\section{The interplay of geography, technology, and institutions}
Economists have long debated whether economic wellbeing and progress
are the results of geography, technology, or institutions.
Clearly, this debate is {\underline {misguided.}} These three domains
are interdependent; we cannot understand economic history and economic
change without taking all three into account.









\section{Equestrian}



\subsection{Donkey in Egypt}
It is a pack animal, able to transport goods long distances.
It is a saddle animal, for use in warfare and farming.
It is draft animal, able to pull wheeled vehicles.

It has endurance, intelligence, and great speed.

\subsection{Camel in deserts and high plateaus.}


Not only a pack animal, but a source of milk and meat, a battle animal,
an animal for sport racing. The alpaca was used to produce fine fabrics.



\subsection{Breakthrough in the Fertile Crescent}
From 300 to 1000 CE, decisive civilizational advances in the Fertile
Crescent, including Egypt, the Levant, and Mesopotamia. Similar advances 
occurred in other riverine civilizations (the Indus, the Yellow River,
and the Yangtze).

Breakthrough included technological and institutional advances in 
agriculture, public administration, writing and communications, 
engineering, and long-distance trade.
These breakthroughs gave rise to {\textbf {city-states}} and to 
larger political units.


The Fertile Crescent: written legal codes, public infrastructure, 
tax collection. Mathematics, astronomy, engineering, metallurgy, 
and medicine.






\section{The Classical Age}
We can call this an era of globalization by politics.

\subsection{The Axial Age 800 - 300 BCE}
Called by the twentieth-century German historian and philosopher
Karl Jaspers. During a span of roughly five hundred years, there was 
a simultaneous emergence of profound philosophical and religious 
insights in four major civilizations of Eurasia: the Greco-Roman world
of the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian world of western Asia, the Aryan
world of northern India, and the Han Chinese world of East Asia. In all
four cases, there occurred remarkable and foundational breakthroughs 
in thinking about the meaning and purpose of life.




\subsection{Thalassocracy and Tellurocracy}
Thalatta meaning sea and cracy for power. Tellus for land.


The Phoenicians created perhaps the most consequential thalassocracy
in history, not only because of the accomplishment of crating a network
of maritime trade throughout the Mediterranean region, but also
by inspiring the Greek and Roman empires that followed.

The Phoenicians displayed legendary trading and financial skills but 
{\textbf {not}} military dominance. Thus they were conquered by the
rising tellurocracies of the era.



\subsection{The Emergence of the Classical Land-Based Empires}

Persia attacked mainland Greece in 490 BCE, yielding three historic
results:
1. Athenian victory, Persia's ultimate defeat in the Persian-Greek Wars
in 449 BCE. 2. The victory of Athens at  Marathon gave us the eponymous
twenty-six-mile race. 3. The Wars marked the invention in the West of
the field of historical writing with Herodotus's magnificent and
pathbreaking Histories.


Alexander, the student of Aristotle, the king of Macedonia.


\subsubsection{The Roman Empire}

The Roman Empire defeated Mecedonia during several wars between 214 
and 148 BCE and then went on to conquer the other Hellenistic states,
lies along the familiar east-west axis of the lucky latitudes.(check
figure 5.3)

Roman emperors stopped at the coastal edge of North Africa. To go further
south meant to hit the desert, with its inhospitable and largely
uneconomic environment.

\subsubsection{Global trade within the lucky latitudes}
Three great empires and the northern kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent
engaged in a {\textbf {long-distance}} exchange of technologies,
manufactured goods, and ideas, the so-called {\textbf {Silk Road}}.
